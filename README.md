# Streamlit-Breast-Cancer-Diagnostic-App

## Introduction 
This project aims to develop an interactive web application using Streamlit for predicting breast cancer diagnosis based on the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset. The application provides a user-friendly interface for users to input relevant data and obtain predictions regarding the likelihood of breast cancer diagnosis.  
## Dataset 
The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which is publicly available and widely used for machine learning tasks. It contains features computed from digitized images of breast mass, which are used to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign.
